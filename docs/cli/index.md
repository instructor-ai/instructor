# Instructor CLI

Welcome to the Instructor Command-Line Interface (CLI), a tool designed to ease your experience with the OpenAI API. Whether it's tracking your API usage or fine-tuning your models, Instructor CLI is your go-to utility.

## Quick Start

First things first: make sure your OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable. The CLI will use this for authenticating your requests to OpenAI's services.

You can set the API key in your terminal as follows:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Installation & Setup

```bash
pip install instructor
```
