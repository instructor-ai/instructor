# Getting Started with Instructor

This guide will walk you through the basics of using Instructor to extract structured data from language models. By the end, you'll understand how to:

1. Install and set up Instructor
2. Extract basic structured data
3. Handle validation and errors
4. Work with streaming responses
5. Use different LLM providers

## Installation

First, install Instructor:

```bash
pip install instructor
```

To use a specific provider, install the appropriate extras:

```bash
# For OpenAI (included by default)
pip install instructor

# For Anthropic
pip install "instructor[anthropic]"

# For other providers
pip install "instructor[google-generativeai]"  # For Google/Gemini
pip install "instructor[vertexai]"             # For Vertex AI
pip install "instructor[cohere]"               # For Cohere
pip install "instructor[litellm]"              # For LiteLLM (multiple providers)
pip install "instructor[mistralai]"            # For Mistral
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables / API Keys

You have two options for providing API keys to Instructor:

### Option 1: Environment Variables

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# For Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# For other providers, set relevant API keys
```

### Option 2: Direct API Key Parameter

You can also pass API keys directly when using the unified provider interface:

```python
import instructor

# Pass API key directly to from_provider
client = instructor.from_provider(
    "openai/gpt-4", 
    api_key="your-api-key-here"
)

# Works with any supported provider
anthropic_client = instructor.from_provider(
    "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    api_key="your-anthropic-api-key"
)
```

## Your First Structured Output

Let's start with a simple example using OpenAI:

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define your output structure
class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# Create an instructor-patched client
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

# Extract structured data
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}
    ],
)

print(f"Name: {user_info.name}, Age: {user_info.age}")
# Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 30
```

This example demonstrates the core workflow:
1. Define a Pydantic model for your output structure
2. Patch your LLM client with Instructor
3. Request structured output using the `response_model` parameter

## Using the Unified Provider Interface

The unified provider interface makes it easy to switch between different LLM providers:

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# Using environment variables
client = instructor.from_provider("openai/gpt-4")

# Or using direct API key
client = instructor.from_provider(
    "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Same interface works for all providers
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract: Alice is 25 years old."}
    ],
)

print(f"Name: {user_info.name}, Age: {user_info.age}")
```

## Validation and Error Handling

Instructor leverages Pydantic's validation to ensure your data meets requirements:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int = Field(gt=0, lt=120)  # Age must be between 0 and 120
    
    @field_validator('name')
    def name_must_have_space(cls, v):
        if ' ' not in v:
            raise ValueError('Name must include first and last name')
        return v

# This will make the LLM retry if validation fails
user = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=User,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract: Tom is 25 years old."}
    ],
)
```

## Working with Complex Models

Instructor works seamlessly with nested Pydantic models:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Address(BaseModel):
    street: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip_code: str

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    addresses: List[Address]

person = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=Person,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": """
        Extract: John Smith is 35 years old. 
        He has homes at 123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62704 and 
        456 Oak Ave, Chicago, IL 60601.
        """}
    ],
)
```

## Streaming Responses

For larger responses or better user experience, use streaming:

```python
from instructor import Partial

# Stream the response as it's being generated
stream = client.chat.completions.create_partial(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=Person,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract a detailed person profile for John Smith, 35, who lives in Chicago and Springfield."}
    ],
)

for partial in stream:
    # This will incrementally show the response being built
    print(partial)
```

## Using Different Providers

Instructor supports multiple LLM providers. Here's how to use Anthropic:

```python
import instructor
from anthropic import Anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# Create an instructor-patched Anthropic client
client = instructor.from_anthropic(Anthropic())

user_info = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}
    ],
)

print(f"Name: {user_info.name}, Age: {user_info.age}")
```
