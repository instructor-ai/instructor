# Validation and Reasking

Instead of framing "self-critique" or "self-reflection" in AI as new concepts, we can view them as validation errors with clear error messages that the system can use to self-correct.

## Pydantic

Pydantic offers an customizable and expressive validation framework for Python. Instructor leverages Pydantic's validation framework to provide a uniform developer experience for both code-based and LLM-based validation, as well as a reasking mechanism for correcting LLM outputs based on validation errors. To learn more check out the [Pydantic docs](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/) on validators.

!!! note "Good llm validation is just good validation"

    If you want to see some more examples on validators checkout our blog post [Good LLM validation is just good validation](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/2023/10/23/good-llm-validation-is-just-good-validation/)

### Code-based Validation Example

First define a Pydantic model with a validator using the `Annotation` class from `typing_extensions`.

Enforce a naming rule using Pydantic's built-in validation:

```python hl_lines="5-8 12"
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from pydantic import AfterValidator


def name_must_contain_space(v: str) -> str:
    if " " not in v:
        raise ValueError("Name must contain a space.")
    return v.lower()


class UserDetail(BaseModel):
    age: int
    name: Annotated[str, AfterValidator(name_must_contain_space)]


try:
    person = UserDetail(age=29, name="Jason")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
    """
    1 validation error for UserDetail
    name
      Value error, Name must contain a space. [type=value_error, input_value='Jason', input_type=str]
        For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/value_error
    """
```

#### Output for Code-Based Validation

```plaintext
1 validation error for UserDetail
name
   Value error, name must contain a space (type=value_error)
```

As we can see, Pydantic raises a validation error when the name attribute does not contain a space. This is a simple example, but it demonstrates how Pydantic can be used to validate attributes of a model.

### LLM-Based Validation Example

LLM-based validation can also be plugged into the same Pydantic model. Here, if the answer attribute contains content that violates the rule "don't say objectionable things," Pydantic will raise a validation error.

```python hl_lines="9 15"
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from instructor import llm_validator
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, BeforeValidator
from typing_extensions import Annotated


# Apply the patch to the OpenAI client
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


class QuestionAnswer(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: Annotated[
        str,
        BeforeValidator(llm_validator("don't say objectionable things", client=client)),
    ]


try:
    qa = QuestionAnswer(
        question="What is the meaning of life?",
        answer="The meaning of life is to be evil and steal",
    )
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
    """
    1 validation error for QuestionAnswer
    answer
      Assertion failed, The statement promotes objectionable behavior by encouraging evil and stealing. [type=assertion_error, input_value='The meaning of life is to be evil and steal', input_type=str]
        For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/assertion_error
    """
```

#### Output for LLM-Based Validation

It is important to not here that the error message is generated by the LLM, not the code, so it'll be helpful for re asking the model.

```plaintext
1 validation error for QuestionAnswer
answer
   Assertion failed, The statement is objectionable. (type=assertion_error)
```

## Using Reasking Logic to Correct Outputs

Validators are a great tool for ensuring some property of the outputs. When you use the `patch()` method with the `openai` client, you can use the `max_retries` parameter to set the number of times you can reask the model to correct the output.

It is a great layer of defense against bad outputs of two forms:

1. Pydantic Validation Errors (code or llm based)
2. JSON Decoding Errors (when the model returns a bad response)

### Step 1: Define the Response Model with Validators

Notice that the field validator wants the name in uppercase, but the user input is lowercase. The validator will raise a `ValueError` if the name is not in uppercase.

```python hl_lines="12-17"
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

# Apply the patch to the OpenAI client
client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class UserDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

    @field_validator("name")
    @classmethod
    def validate_name(cls, v):
        if v.upper() != v:
            raise ValueError("Name must be in uppercase.")
        return v
```

### Step 2. Using the Client with Retries

Here, the `UserDetails` model is passed as the `response_model`, and `max_retries` is set to 2.

```python
import instructor
import openai
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI(), mode=instructor.Mode.TOOLS)


class UserDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


model = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserDetails,
    max_retries=2,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract jason is 25 years old"},
    ],
)

print(model.model_dump_json(indent=2))
"""
{
  "name": "Jason",
  "age": 25
}
"""
```

### What happens behind the scenes?

Behind the scenes, the `instructor.from_openai()` method adds a `max_retries` parameter to the `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` method. The `max_retries` parameter will trigger up to 2 reattempts if the `name` attribute fails the uppercase validation in `UserDetails`.

```python
from pydantic import ValidationError


try:
    ...
except ValidationError as e:
    kwargs["messages"].append(response.choices[0].message)
    kwargs["messages"].append(
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Please correct the function call; errors encountered:\n{e}",
        }
    )
```

## Async Validation

Pydantic doesn't support async validators out of the box at the moment. We've implemented two validators that you can use out of the box to run async calls.

This is especially useful if you are making multiple api calls in parallel. This implementation is heavily inspired by [pydantic-async-validation](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-async-validation/tree/64e4190494141c881ade30963390f91c3286dafc).

!!! warning "Async Client Required"

    The async validation features (`async_field_validator` and `async_model_validator`) only work with an asynchronous client (Eg. `AsyncOpenAI()` vs `OpenAI()`).

### Field Validators

To use the `async_field_validator`, all you'll need to do is to define your standard Pydantic `BaseModel` and import in the `async_field_validator` from instructor.

```python hl_lines="11"
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
from instructor import from_openai, async_field_validator
from openai import AsyncOpenAI


class User(BaseModel):
    label: str
    name: str

    @async_field_validator("label", "name") #(1)!
    async def validate_uppercase(self, v: str) -> str:
        if not v.isupper():
            raise ValueError(f"{v} must be an upper cased value")


client = from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())

resp = asyncio.run(
    client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract out a user from this sentence - Ivan is a 27 year old software engineer",
            }
        ],
        response_model=User,
    )
)
print(resp)
#> label='SOFTWARE ENGINEER' name='IVAN'
```

1.  You can set the fields to run the same validator on. We don't support wildcard characters (eg. '\*' ) at this moment but might in the future.

### Model Validators

We can also use a model validator to validate a combination of fields. In this case, we want to make sure that every field is in caps. This helps us to prevent errors.

```python hl_lines="11"
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
from instructor import from_openai,async_model_validator
from openai import AsyncOpenAI


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    occupation: str

    @async_model_validator() #(1)!
    async def validate_uppercase(self):
        if not self.name.isupper() or not self.occupation.isupper():
            raise ValueError("Name and Occupation must be capitalized (Eg. TOM, COOK)")


client = from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())

resp = asyncio.run(
    client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract out a user from this sentence - Ivan is a 27 year old software engineer",
            }
        ],
        response_model=User,
    )
)

assert resp.name == "IVAN"
assert resp.occupation == "SOFTWARE ENGINEER"
```

1. This wil run the validator on the entire model. You can access any of the fields in this manner and it will be propogated up on a model level

### Nested Pydantic Objects

We also support nested validation as long as they inherit from Pydantic's `BaseModel` class

```python hl_lines="9-15"
from instructor import async_model_validator
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
from instructor import from_openai
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import time


class User(BaseModel): #(1)!
    name: str
    occupation: str

    @async_model_validator()
    async def validate_uppercase(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

class Users(BaseModel):
    users: list[User]


client = from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())


start = time.time()
resp = asyncio.run(
    client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract out all the users from this sentence - Thomas is a 24 year old software engineer and has a roomate called Jonathan that is around the same age and works as a Barista",
            }
        ],
        response_model=Users,
    )
)
end = time.time()
print(f"Elapsed Time: {end-start}")
# > Elapsed Time: 3.375563859939575
print(resp.model_dump_json())
# {
#     "users": [
#         {"name": "Thomas", "occupation": "software engineer"},
#         {"name": "Jonathan", "occupation": "Barista"},
#     ]
# }
```

1. As long as the class inherits from the `BaseModel` class, we'll be able to run the validation you define on a property

### Validation Context

Sometimes, you might want your validators to be able to access some context you provide at runtime.

We allow you to access an arbitrary dictionary by defining an `info` parameter of type `ValidationInfo` in both the `async_model_validator` and `async_field_validator` objects.

```python hl_lines="13-17 37"
from pydantic import ValidationInfo, BaseModel
from instructor import async_model_validator
import asyncio
from instructor import from_openai
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import time


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    occupation: str

    @async_model_validator()
    async def validate_uppercase(self, info: ValidationInfo): #(1)!
        context = info.context
        if context and self.name in context.get("forbidden_names", []):
            raise ValueError(f"Do not include the name {self.name}")


class Users(BaseModel):
    users: list[User]


client = from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())


resp = asyncio.run(
    client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract out all the users from this sentence - Thomas is a 24 year old software engineer and has a roomate called Jonathan that is around the same age and works as a Barista",
            }
        ],
        response_model=Users,
        validation_context={"forbidden_names": "Thomas"}, #(2)!
    )
)
print(resp.model_dump_json())
# {"users": [{"name": "Jonathan", "occupation": "Barista"}]}
```

1.  To access the Validation Context in a validator, just define a property called `info:ValidationInfo` from Pydantic
2.  You can pass in any arbitrary dictionary here for use in the validation_context

We also support the same api with the `field_validator` decorator

```python hl_lines="12-16 36"
from pydantic import ValidationInfo,BaseModel
from instructor import async_field_validator
import asyncio
from instructor import from_openai
from openai import AsyncOpenAI


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    occupation: str

    @async_field_validator("name") #(1)!
    async def validate_uppercase(self, v: str, info: ValidationInfo):
        context = info.context
        if context and v in context.get("forbidden_names", []):
            raise ValueError(f"Do not include the user {v}")


class Users(BaseModel):
    users: list[User]


client = from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())


resp = asyncio.run(
    client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract out all the users from this sentence - Thomas is a 24 year old software engineer and has a roomate called Jonathan that is around the same age and works as a Barista",
            }
        ],
        response_model=Users,
        validation_context={"forbidden_names": "Thomas"}, #(2)!
    )
)
print(resp.model_dump_json())
# {"users": [{"name": "Jonathan", "occupation": "Barista"}]}
```

1.  To access the Validation Context in a validator, just define a property called `info:ValidationInfo` from Pydantic
2.  You can pass in any arbitrary dictionary here for use in the validation_context

## Advanced Validation Techniques

The docs are currently incomplete, but we have a few advanced validation techniques that we're working on documenting better such as model level validation, and using a validation context. Check out our example on [verifying citations](../examples/exact_citations.md) which covers:

1. Validate the entire object with all attributes rather than one attribute at a time
2. Using some 'context' to validate the object: In this case, we use the `context` to check if the citation existed in the original text.

## Optimizing Token usage

Pydantic automatically includes a URL within the error message itself when an error is thrown so that users can learn more about the specific error that was thrown. Some users might want to remove this URL since it adds extra tokens that otherwise might not add much value to the validation process.

We've created a small helper function that you can use below which removes this url in the error message

```python hl_lines="6"
from instructor.utils import disable_pydantic_error_url
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from pydantic import AfterValidator

disable_pydantic_error_url() # (1)!


def name_must_contain_space(v: str) -> str:
    if " " not in v:
        raise ValueError("Name must contain a space.")
    return v.lower()


class UserDetail(BaseModel):
    age: int
    name: Annotated[str, AfterValidator(name_must_contain_space)]


try:
    person = UserDetail(age=29, name="Jason")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
    """
    1 validation error for UserDetail
    name
        Value error, Name must contain a space. [type=value_error, input_value='Jason', input_type=str]
    """
```

1.  We disable the error by setting an environment variable `PYDANTIC_ERRORS_INCLUDE_URL` to `0`. This is valid only for the duration that the script is executed for, once the function is not called, the original behaviour is restored.

## Takeaways

By integrating these advanced validation techniques, we not only improve the quality and reliability of LLM-generated content, but also pave the way for more autonomous and effective systems.
