| 3. [Applications: RAG](./3-0-applications-rag.ipynb) | Retrieval-augmented generation | Information retrieval, context handling | 🟡 Intermediate |
| 4. [Applications: RAG Validation](./3-1-validation-rag.ipynb) | Validating RAG outputs | Quality control, validation hooks | 🟡 Intermediate |
| 5. [Validation Techniques](./4-validation.ipynb) | Deep validation | Custom validators, error handling | 🟡 Intermediate |
| 6. [Knowledge Graphs](./5-knowledge-graphs.ipynb) | Graph building | Entity relationships, graph visualization | 🔴 Advanced |
| 7. [Chain of Density](./6-chain-of-density.ipynb) | Summarization techniques | Iterative refinement, content density | 🔴 Advanced |
| 8. [Synthetic Data Generation](./7-synthetic-data-generation.ipynb) | Creating datasets | Data augmentation, testing data | 🔴 Advanced |

## Running Options {#running-options}

Choose your preferred environment to work through these interactive Jupyter notebooks:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-laptop: **Run Locally**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jxnl/instructor.git
    cd instructor
    pip install -e ".[all]"
    jupyter notebook docs/tutorials/
    ```

- :material-google: **Google Colab**

    Look for the "Open in Colab" button at the top of each notebook
    
    Perfect for cloud execution without local setup

- :simple-mybinder: **Binder**

    Click the "Launch Binder" button to run instantly in your browser
    
    No installation or API keys required for basic examples
