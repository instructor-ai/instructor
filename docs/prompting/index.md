## Implementation with Instructor

All these prompting techniques can be implemented with Instructor by:

1. Defining appropriate Pydantic models that capture the expected structure
2. Incorporating the prompting technique in your model docstrings or field descriptions
3. Using the patched LLM client with your response model

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Example implementing Chain of Thought with a field
class ReasonedAnswer(BaseModel):
    """Answer the following question with detailed reasoning."""
    
    chain_of_thought: str = Field(
        description="Step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem"
    )
    final_answer: str = Field(
        description="The final conclusion after reasoning"
    )

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    response_model=ReasonedAnswer,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the cube root of 27?"}
    ]
)

print(f"Reasoning: {response.chain_of_thought}")
print(f"Answer: {response.final_answer}")
```
