# Prompting Guide

Prompting requires an understanding of techniques to enhance model performance.

The team at [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org) released The [Prompt Report](https://trigaten.github.io/Prompt_Survey_Site) in collaboration with researchers from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google.
This report surveys over 1,500 prompting papers and condenses the findings into a list of 58 distinct prompting techniques.

Here are examples of the 58 prompting techniques<sup>*</sup> using `instructor`.

Prompting techniques are separated into the following categories:
- [Prompting Guide](#prompting-guide)
  - [Zero-Shot](#zero-shot)
  - [Few-Shot](#few-shot)
  - [Thought Generation](#thought-generation)
      - [Zero Shot](#zero-shot-1)
      - [Few Shot](#few-shot-1)
  - [Ensembling](#ensembling)
  - [Self-Criticism](#self-criticism)
  - [Decomposition](#decomposition)

## Zero-Shot
How do we increase the performance of our model without any examples?

1. [Use Emotional Language](zero_shot/emotion_prompting.md)
2. [Assign a Role](zero_shot/role_prompting.md)
3. [Define a Style](zero_shot/style_prompting.md)
4. [Auto-Refine The Prompt](zero_shot/s2a.md)
5. [Simulate a Perspective](zero_shot/simtom.md)
6. [Clarify Ambiguous Information](zero_shot/rar.md)
7. [Ask Model To Repeat Query](zero_shot/re2.md)
8. [Generate Follow-Up Questions](zero_shot/self_ask.md)

## Few-Shot

How do we choose effective examples to include in our prompt?

1. [Auto-Generate Examples](few_shot/example_generation/sg_icl.md)
2. [Re-Order Examples](few_shot/example_ordering.md)
3. [Choose Examples Similar to the Query (KNN)](few_shot/exemplar_selection/knn.md)

9. [Choose Similar, Auto-Generated, High-Certainty Chain-Of-Thought Reasonings](thought_generation/chain_of_thought_few_shot/memory_of_thought.md)
10. [Choose the Most Certain Reasoning](thought_generation/chain_of_thought_few_shot/uncertainty_routed_cot.md)
11. [Generate Template-Based Prompts](thought_generation/chain_of_thought_few_shot/prompt_mining.md)

## Ensembling

How can we use multiple prompts and aggregate their responses?

1. [Build a Set of Consistent, Diverse Examples](ensembling/cosp.md)
2. [Batch In-Context Examples](ensembling/dense.md)
3. [Verify Individual Reasoning Steps](ensembling/diverse.md)
4. [Maximize Information Between Input and Output](ensembling/max_mutual_information.md)
5. [Merge Multiple Chains-Of-Thought](ensembling/meta_cot.md)
6. [Use Specialized Experts](ensembling/more.md)
7. [Choose The Most Consistent Reasoning](ensembling/self_consistency.md)
8. [Choose The Most Consistent Reasioning (Universal)](ensembling/universal_self_consistency.md)
9. [Use Task-Specific Example Selection](ensembling/usp.md)
10. [Paraphrase The Prompt](ensembling/prompt_paraphrasing.md)

## Self-Criticism

How can a model verify or critique its own response?

1. [Generate Verification Questions](self_criticism/chain_of_verification.md)
2. [Ask If the Answer is Correct](self_criticism/self_calibration.md)
3. [Generate Feedback and Auto-Improve](self_criticism/self_refine.md)
