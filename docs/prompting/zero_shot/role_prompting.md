description: "Role prompting, or persona prompting, assigns a role to the model."
---

How can we increase a model's performance on open-ended tasks?

Role prompting, or persona prompting, assigns a role to the model. Roles can be:
 
 - **specific to the query**: *You are a talented writer. Write me a poem.*
 - **general/social**: *You are a helpful AI assistant. Write me a poem.*

## Implementation

```python hl_lines="27"
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class Response(BaseModel):
    poem: str


def role_prompting(query, role):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        response_model=Response,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": f"{role} {query}",
            },
        ],
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "Write me a short poem about coffee."
    role = "You are a renowned poet."

    response = role_prompting(query, role)
    print(response.poem)
    """
    In the morning's gentle light,
    A brew of warmth, dark and bright.
    Awakening dreams, so sweet,
    In every sip, the day we greet.

    Through the steam, stories spin,
    A liquid muse, caffeine within.
    Moments pause, thoughts unfold,
    In coffee's embrace, we find our gold.
    """
```
