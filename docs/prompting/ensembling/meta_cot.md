description: "Meta Chain Of Thought involves decomposing an initial query into multiple sub questions. We then aggregate the response from each of these chains as context before prompting another LLM to generate a response"

Meta Chain Of Thought (Meta COT) <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13007">1</a></sup>. involves the use of multiple reasoning chains to generate a response to a given query. This helps our model evaluate multiple potential reasoning paths and from there, determine a more accurate answer.

We can implement this using `instructor` as seen below.

```python hl_lines="41-42 57-61 96-99"

        the reasoning chain was unable to generate
        a result"""
    )
