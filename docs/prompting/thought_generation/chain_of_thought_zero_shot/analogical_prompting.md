Analogical Prompting<sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01714">1</a></sup> is a method that aims to get LLMs to generate examples that are relevant to the problem before starting to address the user's query.

This takes advantage of the various forms of knowledge that the LLM has acquired during training and explicitly prompts them to recall the relevant problems and solutions. We can use Analogical Prompting using the following template

!!! example "Analogical Prompting Prompt Template"

    Problem: [User Prompt]

    Relevant Problems: Recall three relevant and distinct problems. For each problem, describe it and explain the solution

    Solve the problem

We can implement this using `instructor` as seen below with some slight modifications.

```python hl_lines="33-36"
from openai import OpenAI

import instructor

client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

    solution: str


class Response(BaseModel):
    relevant_problems: list[RelevantProblem] = Field(
        max_length=3,
        min_length=3,
    )
    answer: RelevantProblem
