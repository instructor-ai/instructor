# Structured Outputs with Multimodal Gemini

In this post, we'll explore how to use Google's Gemini model with Instructor to analyze [travel videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8yhW_H9NQ) and extract structured recommendations. This powerful combination allows us to process multimodal inputs (video) and generate structured outputs using Pydantic models. This post was done in collaboration with [Kino.ai](https://kino.ai), a company that uses instructor to do structured extraction from multimodal inputs to improve search for film makers.

## Setting Up the Environment

First, let's set up our environment with the necessary libraries:

```python

```

<!-- more -->

## Defining Our Data Models

We'll use Pydantic to define our data models for tourist destinations and recommendations:

```python
class TouristDestination(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    location: str


class Recommendations(BaseModel):
    chain_of_thought: str
    description: str
    destinations: list[TouristDestination]
```

## Initializing the Gemini Client

Next, we'll set up our Gemini client using Instructor:

```python
client = instructor.from_gemini(
    client=genai.GenerativeModel(
        model_name="models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest",
    ),
)
```

## Uploading and Processing the Video

To analyze a video, we first need to upload it:

```python
file = genai.upload_file("./takayama.mp4")
```

Then, we can process the video and extract recommendations:

```python
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": ["What places do they recommend in this video?", file],
        }
    ],
    response_model=Recommendations,
)

print(resp)
```

The Gemini model analyzes the video and provides structured recommendations. Here's a summary of the extracted information:

1. **Takayama City**: The main destination, located in the Hida Region of Gifu Prefecture.
2. **Miyagawa Morning Market**: A historic market open daily from 7am to noon.
3. **Nakaya Shop**: Sells handcrafted Sarubobo good luck charms.
4. **Koma Coffee**: A 50-60 year old shop famous for serving coffee in cookie cups.
5. **Kissako Katsure**: A traditional Japanese cafe offering various teas and sweets.
6. **Sanmachi Historic District**: A preserved merchant district from the Edo Period.
7. **Suwa Orchard**: A 50+ year old orchard business.
8. **Kitchen HIDA**: A restaurant with a 50-year history, known for Hida Beef dishes.
9. **Kin no Kotte Ushi**: A shop specializing in Hida Wagyu Beef Sushi.
10. **Shirakawa-go**: A World Heritage Site in Gifu Prefecture.

## Limitations, Challenges, and Future Directions

While the current approach demonstrates the power of multimodal AI for video analysis, there are several limitations and challenges to consider:

1. **Lack of Temporal Information**: Our current method extracts overall recommendations but doesn't provide timestamps for specific mentions. This limits the ability to link recommendations to exact moments in the video.

2. **Speaker Diarization**: The model doesn't distinguish between different speakers in the video. Implementing speaker diarization could provide valuable context about who is making specific recommendations.

3. **Content Density**: Longer or more complex videos might overwhelm the model, potentially leading to missed information or less accurate extractions.

### Future Explorations

To address these limitations and expand the capabilities of our video analysis system, here are some promising areas to explore:

1. **Timestamp Extraction**: Enhance the model to provide timestamps for each recommendation or point of interest mentioned in the video. This could be achieved by:

   ```python
   class TimestampedRecommendation(BaseModel):
       timestamp: str
       timestamp_format: Literal["HH:MM", "HH:MM:SS"]  # Helps with parsing
       recommendation: str


   class EnhancedRecommendations(BaseModel):
       destinations: list[TouristDestination]
       timestamped_mentions: list[TimestampedRecommendation]
   ```

2. **Speaker Diarization**: Implement speaker recognition to attribute recommendations to specific individuals. This could be particularly useful for videos featuring multiple hosts or interviewees.

3. **Segment-based Analysis**: Process longer videos in segments to maintain accuracy and capture all relevant information. This approach could involve:

   - Splitting the video into smaller chunks
   - Analyzing each chunk separately
   - Aggregating and deduplicating results

4. **Multi-language Support**: Extend the model's capabilities to accurately analyze videos in various languages and capture culturally specific recommendations.

5. **Visual Element Analysis**: Enhance the model to recognize and describe visual elements like landmarks, food dishes, or activities shown in the video, even if not explicitly mentioned in the audio.

6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge the speaker's enthusiasm or reservations about specific recommendations.

By addressing these challenges and exploring these new directions, we can create a more comprehensive and nuanced video analysis system, opening up even more possibilities for applications in travel, education, and beyond.
