We would love for you to contribute to `Instructor`.

## [Evals](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/llm/test_openai/evals)

We invite you to contribute evals in pytest as a way to monitor the quality of the openai models and the instructor library. To get started check out the [jxnl/instructor/tests/llm/test_openai/evals](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/llm/test_openai/evals) and contribute your own evals in the form of pytest tests. These evals will be run once a week and the results will be posted.

## Additional Resources

To enhance your understanding of the documentation, here are some useful references:

> Learn more in the [mkdocs serve documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/commands/serve/) and make sure to install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements-doc.txt` before running the command.

- **mkdocs serve:** The `mkdocs serve` command is used to preview your documentation locally during the development phase. When you run this command in your terminal, MkDocs starts a development server, allowing you to view and interact with your documentation in a web browser. This is helpful for checking how your changes look before publishing the documentation.

- **hl_lines in Code Blocks:** The `hl_lines` feature in code blocks allows you to highlight specific lines within the code block. This is useful for drawing attention to particular lines of code when explaining examples or providing instructions. You can specify the lines to highlight using the `hl_lines` option in your code block configuration. For more details and examples, you can refer to the [hl_lines documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#syntax-highlighting).

- **Admonitions:** Admonitions are a way to visually emphasize or call attention to certain pieces of information in your documentation. They come in various styles, such as notes, warnings, tips, etc. Admonitions provide a structured and consistent way to present important content. For usage examples and details on incorporating admonitions into your documentation, you can refer to the [admonitions documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#admonitions).

For more details about the documentation structure and features, refer to the [MkDocs Material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Thank you for your contributions, and happy coding!
