"""
Proof of Concept for a task planning and execution system using
OpenAIs Functions and topological sort, based on the idea in 
query_planner_execution.py.py.

Additionally: There are also cases where the "pure" recursive approach has advantages; 
If subtasks for different parent tasks that start in parallel have different runtimes, 
we will wait unnecessarily with my current implementation.
