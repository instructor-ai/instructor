## Get Started in Minutes

Install Instructor with a single command:

**Recommended (using uv):**
```bash
uv add instructor
```

**Alternative (using pip):**
```bash
pip install -U instructor
```

> **Note:** We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster package installation and better dependency resolution. If you're contributing to the project, uv is required for development.

Now, let's see Instructor in action with a simple example:

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


# Define your desired output structure
class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


# Patch the OpenAI client
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

# Extract structured data from natural language
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}],
)

print(user_info.name)
#> John Doe
print(user_info.age)
#> 30
```

### Provider Initialization

Instructor provides a simple way to work with different providers using a consistent interface:

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# Initialize client for any supported provider
client = instructor.from_provider("openai/gpt-4")  # OpenAI
client = instructor.from_provider("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")  # Anthropic
client = instructor.from_provider("google/gemini-pro")  # Google
client = instructor.from_provider("mistral/mistral-large")  # Mistral
# ... and many more providers

# Use the same interface across all providers
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}],
)
```

The `from_provider` function supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage with `async_client=True`, and works with all supported providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, Writer, AWS Bedrock, Cerebras, Fireworks, Vertex AI, and more.

### Using Hooks

Instructor provides a powerful hooks system that allows you to intercept and log various stages of the LLM interaction process. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use hooks:

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel


class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


# Initialize the OpenAI client with Instructor
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


# Define hook functions
def log_kwargs(**kwargs):
    print(f"Function called with kwargs: {kwargs}")


def log_exception(exception: Exception):
    print(f"An exception occurred: {str(exception)}")


client.on("completion:kwargs", log_kwargs)
client.on("completion:error", log_exception)

user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract the user name: 'John is 20 years old'"}
    ],
)

"""
{
        'args': (),
        'kwargs': {
            'messages': [
                {
                    'role': 'user',
                    'content': "Extract the user name: 'John is 20 years old'",
                }
            ],
            'model': 'gpt-4o-mini',
            'tools': [
                {
                    'type': 'function',
                    'function': {
                        'name': 'UserInfo',
                        'description': 'Correctly extracted `UserInfo` with all the required parameters with correct types',
                        'parameters': {
                            'properties': {
                                'name': {'title': 'Name', 'type': 'string'},
                                'age': {'title': 'Age', 'type': 'integer'},
                            },
                            'required': ['age', 'name'],
                            'type': 'object',
                        },
                    },
                }
            ],
            'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'UserInfo'}},
        },
    }
"""

print(f"Name: {user_info.name}, Age: {user_info.age}")
#> Name: John, Age: 20
```

This example demonstrates:

1. A pre-execution hook that logs all kwargs passed to the function.
2. An exception hook that logs any exceptions that occur during execution.

The hooks provide valuable insights into the function's inputs and any errors,
enhancing debugging and monitoring capabilities.

### Using Anthropic Models

```python
import instructor
from anthropic import Anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_anthropic(Anthropic())

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="You are a world class AI that excels at extracting user data from a sentence",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Cohere Models

Make sure to install `cohere` and set your system environment variable with `export CO_API_KEY=<YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY>`.

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add cohere

# Using pip
pip install cohere
```

```python
import instructor
import cohere
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_cohere(cohere.Client())

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="command-r-plus",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Gemini Models

Make sure you [install](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai#setup) the Google AI Python SDK. You should set a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.
Gemini tool calling also requires `jsonref` to be installed.

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add google-generativeai jsonref

# Using pip
pip install google-generativeai jsonref
```

```python
import instructor
import google.generativeai as genai
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


# genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["API_KEY"]) # alternative API key configuration
client = instructor.from_gemini(
    client=genai.GenerativeModel(
        model_name="models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest",  # model defaults to "gemini-pro"
    ),
    mode=instructor.Mode.GEMINI_JSON,
)
```

Alternatively, you can [call Gemini from the OpenAI client](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/call-gemini-using-openai-library#python). You'll have to setup [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#local-dev), get setup on Vertex AI, and install the Google Auth library.

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add google-auth

# Using pip
pip install google-auth
```

```python
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

creds, project = google.auth.default()
auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
creds.refresh(auth_req)

# Pass the Vertex endpoint and authentication to the OpenAI SDK
PROJECT = 'PROJECT_ID'
LOCATION = (
    'LOCATION'  # https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations
)
base_url = f'https://{LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/{PROJECT}/locations/{LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi'

client = instructor.from_openai(
    OpenAI(base_url=base_url, api_key=creds.token), mode=instructor.Mode.JSON
)


# JSON mode is req'd
class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemini-1.5-flash-001",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Perplexity Sonar Models

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_perplexity(OpenAI(base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai"))

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Litellm

```python
import instructor
from litellm import completion
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_litellm(completion)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

## Types are inferred correctly

This was the dream of Instructor but due to the patching of OpenAI, it wasn't possible for me to get typing to work well. Now, with the new client, we can get typing to work well! We've also added a few `create_*` methods to make it easier to create iterables and partials, and to access the original completion.

### Calling `create`

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())

user = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)
```

Now if you use an IDE, you can see the type is correctly inferred.

![type](./docs/blog/posts/img/type.png)

### Handling async: `await create`

This will also work correctly with asynchronous clients.

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.AsyncOpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


async def extract():
    return await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
        ],
        response_model=User,
    )
```

Notice that simply because we return the `create` method, the `extract()` function will return the correct user type.

![async](./docs/blog/posts/img/async_type.png)

### Returning the original completion: `create_with_completion`

You can also return the original completion object

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


user, completion = client.chat.completions.create_with_completion(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)
```

![with_completion](./docs/blog/posts/img/with_completion.png)

### Streaming Partial Objects: `create_partial`

In order to handle streams, we still support `Iterable[T]` and `Partial[T]` but to simplify the type inference, we've added `create_iterable` and `create_partial` methods as well!

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


user_stream = client.chat.completions.create_partial(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

for user in user_stream:
    print(user)
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name='John Doe' age=None
    #> name='John Doe' age=None
    #> name='John Doe' age=None
    #> name='John Doe' age=30
    #> name='John Doe' age=30
    # name=None age=None
    # name='' age=None
    # name='John' age=None
    # name='John Doe' age=None
    # name='John Doe' age=30
```

Notice now that the type inferred is `Generator[User, None]`

![generator](./docs/blog/posts/img/generator.png)

### Streaming Iterables: `create_iterable`

We get an iterable of objects when we want to extract multiple objects.

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


users = client.chat.completions.create_iterable(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 users"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

for user in users:
    print(user)
    #> name='John Doe' age=30
    #> name='Jane Doe' age=28
    # User(name='John Doe', age=30)
    # User(name='Jane Smith', age=25)
```

## [Evals](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/llm/test_openai/evals#how-to-contribute-writing-and-running-evaluation-tests)

We invite you to contribute to evals in `pytest` as a way to monitor the quality of the OpenAI models and the `instructor` library. To get started check out the evals for [Anthropic](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/blob/main/tests/llm/test_anthropic/evals/test_simple.py) and [OpenAI](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/llm/test_openai/evals#how-to-contribute-writing-and-running-evaluation-tests) and contribute your own evals in the form of pytest tests. These evals will be run once a week and the results will be posted.

## Repository Overview

Below is a quick tour of the repository's main directories. See [docs/repository-overview.md](docs/repository-overview.md) for more details.

- **instructor/** – core library code with clients and utilities.
- **cli/** – command-line tools for managing jobs and usage.
- **docs/** – documentation sources for the MkDocs site.
- **examples/** – cookbook examples showcasing Instructor.
- **tests/** – unit tests and evaluation suites.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Instructor! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or writing blog posts, your help is appreciated.

### Getting Started

If you're new to the project, check out issues marked as [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help-wanted`](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/labels/help%20wanted). These could be anything from code improvements, a guest blog post, or a new cookbook.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/instructor.git
   cd instructor
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment**
   
   We use `uv` to manage dependencies, which provides faster package installation and dependency resolution than traditional tools. If you don't have `uv` installed, [install it first](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
   
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies with all extras 
   # You can specify specific groups if needed
   uv sync --all-extras --group dev
   
   # Or for a specific integration
   # uv sync --all-extras --group dev,anthropic
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   
   We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and keep `uv.lock` synchronized:
   
   ```bash
   uv pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
   
   This will automatically run formatters, linting checks, and dependency validation before each commit.

### Running Tests

Tests help ensure that your contributions don't break existing functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py

# Run tests with coverage reporting
uv run pytest --cov=instructor
```

### Code Style and Quality Requirements

We maintain high code quality standards to keep the codebase maintainable and consistent:

- **Formatting and Linting**: We use `ruff` for code formatting and linting, and `pyright` for type checking.
  ```bash
  # Check code formatting
  uv run ruff format --check
  
  # Apply formatting
  uv run ruff format
  
  # Run linter
  uv run ruff check
  
  # Fix auto-fixable linting issues
  uv run ruff check --fix
  ```

- **Type Hints**: All new code should include proper type hints.

- **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented with docstrings and comments where appropriate.

Make sure these checks pass when you submit a PR:
- Linting: `uv run ruff check`
- Formatting: `uv run ruff format`
- Type checking: `uv run pyright`

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch for your changes**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit them**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Keep your branch updated with the main repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor.git
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

4. **Push your changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository.

2. **Fill out the PR template** with a description of your changes, relevant issue numbers, and any other information that would help reviewers understand your contribution.

3. **Address review feedback** and make any requested changes.

4. **Wait for CI checks** to pass. The PR will be reviewed by maintainers once all checks are green.

5. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### Contributing to Evals

We encourage contributions to our evaluation tests. See the [Evals documentation](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/llm/test_openai/evals#how-to-contribute-writing-and-running-evaluation-tests) for details on writing and running evaluation tests.

## CLI

We also provide some added CLI functionality for easy convenience:

- `instructor jobs` : This helps with the creation of fine-tuning jobs with OpenAI. Simply use `instructor jobs create-from-file --help` to get started creating your first fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model

- `instructor files` : Manage your uploaded files with ease. You'll be able to create, delete and upload files all from the command line

- `instructor usage` : Instead of heading to the OpenAI site each time, you can monitor your usage from the CLI and filter by date and time period. Note that usage often takes ~5-10 minutes to update from OpenAI's side
