*Structured extraction in Python, powered by OpenAI's function calling api, designed for simplicity, transparency, and control.*

This library is built to interact with openai's function call api from python code, with python structs / objects. It's designed to be intuitive, easy to use, but give great visibily in how we call openai.

### Requirements

This library depends on **Pydantic** and **OpenAI** that's all.

### Installation

To get started with OpenAI Function Call, you need to install it using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ pip install instructor
```

## Quick Start with Patching ChatCompletion

To simplify your work with OpenAI models and streamline the extraction of Pydantic objects from prompts, we offer a patching mechanism for the `ChatCompletion`` class. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Import and Patch the Module

First, import the required libraries and apply the patch function to the OpenAI module. This exposes new functionality with the response_model parameter.

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel

instructor.patch()
```

### Step 2: Define the Pydantic Model

Create a Pydantic model to define the structure of the data you want to extract. This model will map directly to the information in the prompt.

```python
class UserDetail(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
```

### Step 3: Extract Data with ChatCompletion

Use the openai.ChatCompletion.create method to send a prompt and extract the data into the Pydantic object. The response_model parameter specifies the Pydantic model to use for extraction.

```python
user: UserDetail = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserDetail,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old"},
    ]
)
```

### Step 4: Validate the Extracted Data

You can then validate the extracted data by asserting the expected values. By adding the type things you also get a bunch of nice benefits with your IDE like spell check and auto complete!

```python
assert user.name == "Jason"
assert user.age == 25
```

### LLM-Based Validation

LLM-based validation can also be plugged into the same Pydantic model. Here, if the answer attribute contains content that violates the rule "don't say objectionable things," Pydantic will raise a validation error.

```python hl_lines="9 15"
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, BeforeValidator
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from instructor import llm_validator

class QuestionAnswer(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: Annotated[
        str, 
        BeforeValidator(llm_validator("don't say objectionable things"))
    ]

try:
    qa = QuestionAnswer(
        question="What is the meaning of life?",
        answer="The meaning of life is to be evil and steal",
    )
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
```

Its important to not here that the error message is generated by the LLM, not the code, so it'll be helpful for re asking the model.

```plaintext
1 validation error for QuestionAnswer
answer
   Assertion failed, The statement is objectionable. (type=assertion_error)
```

## Using the Client with Retries

Here, the `UserDetails` model is passed as the `response_model`, and `max_retries` is set to 2.

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

# Apply the patch to the OpenAI client
instructor.patch()

class UserDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

    @field_validator("name")
    @classmethod
    def validate_name(cls, v):
        if v.upper() != v:
            raise ValueError("Name must be in uppercase.")
        return v

model = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserDetails,
    max_retries=2,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract jason is 25 years old"},
    ],
)

assert model.name == "JASON"
```

## IDE Support 

Everything is designed for you to get the best developer experience possible, with the best editor support.

Including **autocompletion**:
