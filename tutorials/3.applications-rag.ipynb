    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models are the bridge between large language models and external knowledge databases. They fetch the relevant data for a given query. For example, if you have some documents and want to ask questions related to the content of those documents, RAG models help by retrieving data from those documents and passing it to the LLM in queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do RAG models work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical RAG process involves embedding a user query and searching a vector database to find the most relevant information to supplement the generated response. This approach is particularly effective when the database contains information closely matching the query but not more than that.\n",
