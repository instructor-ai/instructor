Alice: Hey team, we have several critical tasks we need to tackle for the upcoming release. First, we need to work on improving the authentication system. It's a top priority.

Bob: Got it, Alice. I can take the lead on the authentication improvements. Are there any specific areas you want me to focus on?

Alice: Good question, Bob. We need both a front-end revamp and back-end optimization. So basically, two sub-tasks.

Carol: I can help with the front-end part of the authentication system.

Bob: Great, Carol. I'll handle the back-end optimization then.

Alice: Perfect. Now, after the authentication system is improved, we have to integrate it with our new billing system. That's a medium priority task.

Carol: Is the new billing system already in place?

Alice: No, it's actually another task. So it's a dependency for the integration task. Bob, can you also handle the billing system?

Bob: Sure, but I'll need to complete the back-end optimization of the authentication system first, so it's dependent on that.

Alice: Understood. Lastly, we also need to update our user documentation to reflect all these changes. It's a low-priority task but still important.

Carol: I can take that on once the front-end changes for the authentication system are done. So, it would be dependent on that.

Alice: Sounds like a plan. Let's get these tasks modeled out and get started."""
