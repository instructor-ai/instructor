    # FastAPI App

    This is a FastAPI app that provides some basic math functions.

    ## Usage

    To use this app, follow the instructions below:

    1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    2. Start the app by running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
    3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the Swagger UI documentation.

    ## Example

    To perform a basic math operation, you can use the following curl command:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"operation": "add", "operands": [2, 3]}' http://localhost:8000/calculate
    ```
