Bob: Great, Carol. I'll handle the back-end optimization then.

Alice: Perfect. Now, after the authentication system is improved, we have to integrate it with our new billing system. That's a medium priority task.

Bob: Sure, but I'll need to complete the back-end optimization of the authentication system first, so it's dependent on that.

Jason: The backend optimization was finished last week actually.

Alice: Understood. Lastly, we also need to update our user documentation to reflect all these changes. It's a low-priority task but still important.
